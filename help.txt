In order to make an experiment one need to prepare the experiment root
directory with an arbitrary name, create inside it the directory named `src`
and place into the last one sample wav files with names as
language_genderXX.wav where XX is a unique number.

Then one need to set up environment variable SQE_DATA poiting the experiment
directory and type `make smth` in order to perform the experiment or some of
the experiment part.

The easiest way to make an experiment with data provided by this package is
just to type `make prepare codecs summary`.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
--------------------------
SQE_DATA
	path to the experiment data directory (containing 'src' directory with
	source wav samples)
SQE_RESAMPLE_ONLY 
	just copy 'src' files into the 'input' directory (and resample these
	ones if needed)

TARGETS
--------
make prepare
	create directories needed to perform the experiment
make <codec_id>
	for each input file perform the emulation with current codec/emulator
	settings and then make a quality estimation with PESQ algorithm
make codecs
	do `make <codec_id>` for every codec_id defined in conf.mk
make summary
	get summary results (data tables and plots)
make clean_summary
	clean data tables and plots
make clean
	clean all generated results
